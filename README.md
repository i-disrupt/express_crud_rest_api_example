## Basic Express.js RESTful CRUD  API
This very basic Express.js / Node.js API implements a RESTful CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for a resource I called "tasks"
The API supports the following operations: GET ('/tasks'), POST ('/tasks'), GET ('/tasks/:id'), PUT ('/tasks/:id'), and DELETE ('/tasks/:id')

For this demonstration, I recommend you install [`Insomnia`](https://insomnia.rest/) to test the api routes. This is software I personally use.
